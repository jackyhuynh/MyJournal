        <h2>My Skills.</h2>

        <div class="skill-row">
            <img alt="code-img" class="right-img" src="public/images/code.jpg">
            <h3>Software Design & Development</h3>
            <p><span class="pro">Skills</span>: Problem Solving, software design, programming, communication,
                facilitation, Python, C++, Java, Spring Boot, CI/CD, source control management tools, and DevSecOps best
                practices.</p>
            <p>My journey to becoming a software engineer is a testament to perseverance and a commitment to continuous
                growth. Arriving in the US as an immigrant in late 2011 with no financial resources, formal education,
                or English proficiency, I embarked on a path of self-improvement and professional development.</p>
            <p>In 2013, I enrolled at De Anza College to pursue my passion for software engineering. However, due to
                financial constraints and family responsibilities, I had to temporarily discontinue my studies in 2014.
                Demonstrating my dedication and adaptability, I joined the US Army as an enlisted soldier in 2015,
                gaining valuable discipline and new opportunities.</p>
            <p>In 2017, while serving in the US Army and despite facing technical challenges, I designed a tracking
                database and forecasting inventory system for my company. This initiative resulted in a significant 20%
                reduction in the annual budget and a remarkable 300% annual improvement in operational readiness,
                showcasing my problem-solving abilities in a real-world, high-stakes environment.</p>
            <p>Upon honorable discharge in 2018, I leveraged the educational benefits provided by the Army to pursue my
                Bachelor's degree in Computer and Information Science at ECPI University, graduating in 2019. My pursuit
                of knowledge continued with a Master's degree in Computer Science from Purdue University Fort Wayne,
                which I completed in 2022.</p>
            <p>Throughout this period, I also embraced entrepreneurial endeavors. In 2019, I established Luxe Nails and
                Spa, demonstrating my ability to manage and grow a business. Furthermore, in 2021, I co-founded 7
                Figures Traders, taking on a key developer role in building its web application for secure
                communication, trade analysis, and training materials.</p>
            <p>These academic and entrepreneurial pursuits were complemented by diverse work experiences, including
                roles in construction, as a cashier, and as a certified nails technician, each contributing to my
                well-rounded skill set and understanding of different industries.</p>
            <p>Most recently, I played a crucial role in developing a mission-critical data aggregation and
                visualization application for Army Senior Leaders. This project successfully addressed a long-standing
                challenge, resulting in 100% user adoption. Beyond specific applications, I also spearheaded initiatives
                to streamline the deployment process for new DoD NIPR applications, reducing the timeline from over
                three months to under two weeks. This involved codebase refactoring, implementing robust testing within
                our pipelines, and adopting new technologies, which led to the elimination of over 200 critical
                vulnerabilities, a reduction in technical debt, and improved platform reliability.</p>
            <p>My core tools include software design, prototyping, Java, Python, databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), HTML,
                JavaScript, CSS, image editing, C#, GitLab, Git, Bash, and automation. My portfolio includes projects
                such as a enterprise web application, distributed system and data analysis tools.</p>
            <p>In 2022, I expanded my expertise in CI/CD and cloud computing (AWS) at the <b>Army Software Factory</b>.
                This experience involved navigating significant challenges and collaborating with talented individuals,
                which accelerated my professional growth. Key achievements included building new cloud infrastructure
                from the ground up, establishing maintainable CI/CD pipelines (GitLab, Bash, automation, and Python),
                analyzing and enhancing legacy applications (C# thick application, React, Web server), and developing
                applications supporting Army and DOD missions. The opportunity to work with exceptional colleagues and
                leadership was invaluable.</p>
            <p>January 2023 saw the creation of the TPC Manifest Generator. This tool utilizes Helm Charts and Python to
                automate and streamline the cluster environment setup process. This proactive effort significantly
                enhanced efficiency and consistency in our infrastructure deployments.</p>
            <p>Early in my tenure at SWF, I established the development ecosystem for ATAK, WinTAK, and WebTAK plugins.
                This involved creating initial sample plugins for each platform and developing comprehensive
                documentation covering the development pipeline and publishing process. This foundational work enabled
                other software engineers at SWF to onboard quickly and accelerate their production timelines on these
                platforms.</p>
            <p>I also spearheaded the development of TAK on Demand. Recognizing the limitations of local TAK Server
                deployments, our small team of three developed a cloud-based solution on GCP VMs using Python, Flask,
                and React, complemented by bash scripting. This tool significantly reduced the deployment time for
                multiple TAK Servers used for connection and networking testing. By containerizing the TAK Server with
                Docker and employing bash for internal network routing management, we successfully extended its
                accessibility to the cloud environment.</p>
            <p>Another significant undertaking was the Cerberus Server project, aimed at re-engineering the TAK Server
                to align with the principles of the 12-Factor App. To address message loss and user limitations in the
                original server, I leveraged Spring Boot and Spring Integration, along with RabbitMQ Stream for robust
                messaging. Furthermore, I implemented Kubernetes (K8s) to enable seamless application scaling and
                optimize resource consumption. While full deployment was hindered by external inter-device connectivity
                limitations, this project provided invaluable experience in designing and building highly scalable and
                resilient microservices architectures.</p>
            <p>To further support developer education at SWF and Austin Community College, I developed a comprehensive
                open-source C++ Knowledge Base. This resource served as an academic guide, incorporating code samples,
                industry insights, and real-world use cases. It was designed to help developers, from novice to
                advanced, master key C++ concepts, including object-oriented programming, data structures, design
                patterns, robotics, operating systems, machine language, and advanced C++ topics such as data exchange,
                multithreading, and multitasking.</p>
            <p>Beyond the C++ Knowledge Base, I have also developed open-source knowledge bases covering machine
                learning/AI, computer vision, data visualization, ETL processes, data science, problem-solving, and Java
                basics. These resources, drawn from my academic work and practical experience, serve as a personal
                reference library.</p>

            <h3>Data Science, Data Visualization & Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>In 2020, I started exploring data science and machine learning at Purdue University Graduate School
                (PFW). After finishing some courses (Business Analyst using R, R for Bioinformatics, Knowledge Discovery
                & Data Mining, Software Engineering capstone) at PFW, I started using R to develop fully functional web
                applications
                (User Banking & Expense Analyst)
                that have the power of Business Intelligence and Machine Learning built-in. Other data science projects
                can be found on GitHub
                (Real time Fraud Transaction Detection,
                R for Bioinformatics,
                collection of data science & data visualization exercises). During my data science journey, I picked up
                Python (Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn…).
                I love to transform complex data into simple graphs and help everyone understand its meaning.
                My primary data science tools are data tidying skills, R, Python, SQL, and Spreadsheet.
            </p>
            <p>In 2024, to gain a deeper understanding of the data challenges and to support my colleagues in developing
                the ETL process for the Army Pulse Senior Leader Dashboard, I conducted an analysis of over eight
                million records spanning key Army Functional Areas.</p>
